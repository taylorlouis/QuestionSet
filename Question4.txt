QUESTION 4:

If Questioned 3 was changed so that I only had to keep track of one type of brackets it would Greatly simplify the solution.
I would just use a single loop to process the string rather than have any recursion and just keep a running counter.
Every time I hit an open bracket I add one.
Every time I hit a close bracket I subtract one.
If the total at the end is Not zero or ever goes below zero than the brackets do not match
Very simple

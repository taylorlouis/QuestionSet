# QuestionSet
Senior level questions: (~1. Less than 2 Hrs)

If you prefer to write Questions 1 & 2 in a language other than perl that is fine.
Question 1: 
Write code to generate the following histogram display based on the frequency of occurrence of characters in the first argument to the program. Example:

   $ perl histogram.pl "Mississippi borders Tennessee."
   s: #######
   e: #####
   i: ####
    : ##
   n: ##
   p: ##
   r: ##
   .: #
   M: #
   T: #
   b: #
   d: #
   o: #
Question 2: 
Write a Perl program to create an associative array ("hash") named "last_name" 
whose keys are the five first names "Mary", "James", "Thomas", "William", "Elizabeth". 
Set the corresponding values for these keys to be "Li", "O'Day", "Miller", "Garcia", "Davis". 
Then print out the five full names, each on its own line, sorted primarily by length of last name 
and with a secondary sort alphabetically by first name. 

You can program the following questions in any language of your choice and desire
Question 3:
Given a string consists of different types of brackets, write a function to determine the string is balanced.  For example, " ([])" and "[]{}" are balanced but "([)]" and "](){" are not.  You can assume these are the only characters in the string: ()[]{}
Question 4: 
If the string in Question 3 only consists of ( and ), how would it affect your solution from above? For example: " (())" or " (()("



I completed the first 3 questions in PHP rather than Perl since I was given that option.  I hope your client is satisfied with my submission.  Please note:

for Question 1;
execute the script by typing />php Question1.php "Mississippi borders Tennessee."
for Question 2:
I created a text file that contains the specified names that my script will read them from.  Please make sure that it is in the same directory with the script Question2.php when you run it.

for Question 3:
I created a PHP class named Brackets.  Please make sure that file is in the same directory as Question3.php when you run it.
